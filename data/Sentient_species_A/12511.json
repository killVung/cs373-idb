They had long bodies that moved low to the ground on rows of small \"legs\". Their dorsal side was lined with heat-dissipating flaps and olfactory stalks. Beneath each flap was a small mouth that caught tiny creatures attracted to the flap's heat. Each end of the Aganof body ended in a jointed limb tipped with a sharp claw. Blind and deaf, Aganof relied on vibrations and scents for communication."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Aganof were hermaphroditic: all Agonof could lay fertilized eggs in the spawning caves.
