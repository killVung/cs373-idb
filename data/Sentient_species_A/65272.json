Several rancors had been imported to the planet, and they were able to control the beings, bending them to their will. Mounting the rancors, the Amphi-Hydrus rode across the planet, wreaking havoc and destruction wherever they went. Their rampage came to an end when Dac fell under attack from the Galactic Empire, and the Amphi-Hydrus were forced to retreat to the planet's swamps. There, they waited, hoping that another chance would present itself for them to reclaim their former position of power."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Behind the scenes","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Amphi-Hydrus was designed and created by Daren Horley, an entrant in the \"Design An Alien\" competition run by Star Wars Galaxy magazine. The competition was initiated in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 3 (1995), asking fans to contribute their own designs and ideas for aliens inspired by the Star Wars films. Horley was 29 at the time, and although his entry did not actually win, it was nevertheless published in Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 7 (1996), under the \"honorable mentions\" section of the \"16 and up\" division. Leland Chee, the Lucasfilm Ltd. continuity editor, has since declared that the published \"Design an Alien\" material is canon, although the Amphi-Hydrus are yet to be referenced in any other Star Wars material."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Sources","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"\"Design An Alien\"\u2014Star Wars Galaxy Magazine 7","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]}]}
