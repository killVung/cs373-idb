Circa 1000 BBY, the tycoon Thull Vandron gathered seventeen noble houses of the Core Worlds and took them to a hidden cluster of worlds. These planets were divided in two groups, Senex and Juvex. Arportal-Lanin was in Juvex, an area that was assigned to Houses Carbinol, Hallikeenovich, Kassido, Kellermin, Mekuun, Pilor, Sisemon and Sreethyn. These aristocrats found native species in their worlds, and spent one century bending them using starships and blaster cannons. Arporatal-Lanin and the other planets in Juvex became property of the aristocrats."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"By 700 BBY, all the native species of Juvex, including the Arpor-Lan, had been enslaved for so long that they deemed freedom an old myth. But by then the Galactic Republic found Senex and Juvex and began a restless relationship with the ruling houses. Republic pilots heard rumors about the enslaved locals. In 553 BBY, a Republic warlord began to free some of the species in the area. During the Fourth Nantama Synod, the Houses joined the Republic, with Senex and Juvex becoming sectors."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"However, the Galactic Senate was unhappy with the slaving ways of the Houses, as they were violating the Rights of Sentience.
