They grew hair on their heads, on which they also had small, pointed horns that could be concealed by the hair. Another Andalese physical trait was the application of symbiosis grafts to their bodies. As they otherwise resembled Humans, the Andalese could pass for members of that species if they dressed in reasonably loose clothes and hid their horns. Nevertheless, they were distinct enough that, even when not flaunting their identity, they could be recognized by other features or mannerisms.
