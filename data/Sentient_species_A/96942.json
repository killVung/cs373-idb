Their wings were too small to power them for flight, so they used them for pulling themselves across the ground instead. Their wings were tipped with talons to help them do this. They had gray feathers and eyes poorly adjusted to vision. As such, Aeropteryx who left their homeworld often had to wear lenses to help them see."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img4.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20140430180744\/starwars\/images\/8\/8d\/Eras-legends.png"}]},{"title":"Appearances","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"The Mandalorian Armor","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]},{"title":"Sources","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, Vol. III\u00a0","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]}]}
