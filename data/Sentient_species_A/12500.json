They were bipedal, slender beings with long, supple limbs, flat faces, and forked tails. They developed space travel about the same time as the Corellians and Duros, but their technology was not as advanced. Their colonizations were limited to planets near Inysh. The Galactic Empire strip-mined Inysh for kalonterium, resulting in toxic pollution that so devastated the Abinyshi they were believed to be extinct. Small numbers did survive in hiding, and some Abinyshi joined the Alliance to Restore the Republic."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img4.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20140430180744\/starwars\/images\/8\/8d\/Eras-legends.png"}]},{"title":"Appearances","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"\u00a0Study: Pollution Standards Still Endanger Many\u2014HoloNet News Vol. 531 49","elements":[]},{"text":"\"An Extinct Guest\"\u2014Star Wars Adventure Journal 14","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]},{"title":"Sources","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Alien Encounters","elements":[]},{"text":"\"Alien Encounters\"\u2014Star Wars Adventure Journal 14","elements":[]},{"text":"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]}]}
