Many Aefans were exposed to the t'landa Til's Exultation, a biological phenomenon that induced rapturous feeling; consequently, over a hundred Aefans followed the t'landa Til to their colony on the planet Ylesia.

The t'landa Til performed the Exultation, stimulating the brains of many Aefans. Over a hundred Aefans, still enraptured by the sensation, chose to accompany the t'landa Til to the planet Ylesia as \"pilgrims\" for the Cult of The One and The All, an ostensible religious organization. In actuality, the pilgrims were used by the t'landa Til to process the addictive spice glitterstim, which was later sold to profit the kajidic. Han Solo, a Human smuggler formerly linked with the Ylesian operation, was present on Aefao at the time and managed to persuade a few of the Aefans not to travel with the t'landa Til."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Under the Galactic Empire, the Aefans' homeworld was part of Oversector Outer, and it remained part of various Imperial polities until at least 17 ABY."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img3.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20121009050204\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/6\/6f\/Exultation-ERC.jpg\/180px-Exultation-ERC.jpg","caption":"An Exultation ceremony, pictured, duped many Aefans into traveling to Ylesia."}]},{"title":"Behind the scenes","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"A.
