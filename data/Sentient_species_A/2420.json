Lacking ears and noses, their skulls were covered in fine hairs which were very sensitive to sound waves, and their skin was underlaid by glands that allowed them to detect odors. Sharp, bony ridges around their mouths substituted for lips seen in other species. The Adarians had distendable throat pouches; elongating them to emit a loud subsonic call which helped in communication over long distances, reaching over 20 kilometers."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img2.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20090924204849\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/7\/7c\/Adarian-CSWE.jpg\/180px-Adarian-CSWE.jpg","caption":"An Adarian."}]},{"title":"Society and culture","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Adarian society was based around a rigid caste system known as screel'sara.

They had unique, advanced carbon-ice drive technology which they developed before contact with the Galactic Republic. Their native language was Adarese, a written and spoken language; speaking Galactic Basic Standard was difficult for the lipless species and was spoken with a heavy accent.

Located in relative proximity to Dantooine, Adarians welcomed outcast Jedi and Rebel Alliance troops earning Adari the reputation of being a \"refuge planet\"."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Staying out of galactic affairs, the planet was annexed by Grand Admiral Thrawn during his campaigns against the New Republic. When the Imperial Remnant was finally driven from the core, the Adarians joined the Republic, only to be cut off with the invasion by the Yuuzhan Vong in 26 ABY. When the Republic retook Coruscant and reorganized into the Galactic Alliance, the Adarians quickly joined. Remaining neutral in future wars, the species' homeworld was a member of Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire as of 137 ABY."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img3.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20080520083409\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/e\/e2\/Trade_on_the_OITS.jpg\/200px-Trade_on_the_OITS.jpg","caption":"An Adarian onboard Omze's Incredible Traveling Starport."}]},{"title":"Adarian in the galaxy","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Most Adarians active in the galaxy are scouts under the employ of mining corporations or the Adari government, searching for mineral rich planets or moons to exploit.
