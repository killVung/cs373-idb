Both races evolved naturally on the planet, the Nautolans under the water and the Anselmi on what little landmasses there were. Competition for land most likely led to the Anselmi turning into a warlike race. However, as the Nautolans gradually came to the surface and acquired land, they were able to use their natural abilities and strength to overcome the Anselmi. The Nautolans made up the majority of the population, as the Anselmi continually warred amongst themselves diminishing their numbers on the planet."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img4.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20140430180744\/starwars\/images\/8\/8d\/Eras-legends.png"}]},{"title":"Appearances","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"\u00a0Palpatine forms Loyalist Committee\u2014HoloNet News Vol. 531 49","elements":[]},{"text":"\u00a0Kashyyyk \/ Trandoshan Talks Break Down\u2014HoloNet News Vol. 531 50","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones junior novel","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]},{"title":"Sources","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Power of the Jedi Sourcebook","elements":[]},{"text":"\u00a0Fish Out of Water on Wizards.com","elements":[]},{"text":"The Official Star Wars Fact File 63","elements":[]},{"text":"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]}]}
