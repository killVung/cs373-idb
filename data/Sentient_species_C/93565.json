Their bodies were wobbly-fleshed and so as a consequence when they traveled they wore exoskeletal travel suits. On their homeworld, they breathed a very thin atmosphere; to simulate this offworld, they used respirators built into their suits. In 2 BBY, a number of Courataines were present on the planet Bonadan at the same time that Han Solo was there investigating a slaving ring."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img4.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20140430180744\/starwars\/images\/8\/8d\/Eras-legends.png"}]},{"title":"Behind the scenes","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Courataines were created by Brian Daley for his novel Han Solo's Revenge, published by Del Rey in 1979.
