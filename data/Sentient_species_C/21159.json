As a result, many Chromans joined Nolaa Tarkona's Diversity Alliance. After the alliance was defeated and replaced with the Cooperative Council of Independent Planetary Governments by the New Republic they were a species amongst the New Republic Senate that said why they joined the hate group."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img4.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20140430180744\/starwars\/images\/8\/8d\/Eras-legends.png"}]},{"title":"Appearances","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Young Jedi Knights: Diversity Alliance","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]},{"title":"Sources","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"The Essential Chronology","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]}]}
