They instilled martial values in their children from birth, and trained them to fight as soon as they were physically able, even pitting them against much larger opponents.

Following the Battle of Dantooine, a large Yuuzhan Vong invasion force landed on their world and immediately began to wage war on the warrior species. The Cilare gladly met this threat head-on, assembling their armies and marching toward the invasive threat. Despite their strength and their experience, however, they were easily wiped out by the onslaught of the Vong's Fire Breathers."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The warrior species were quickly exterminated as the Yuuzhan Vong pacified their homeworld. Only one warrior, Arbeloa survived to tell the story, and transmitted a signal before he was taken captive aboard a Yuuzhan Vong slaveship Tsam P'ah. During his captivity, the signal was eventually picked up by the two-men crew of the exploratory ship Pythea\u2014the Chiss Panha and her Wookiee companion Sarkkin.

Given that Panha's species, the Chiss, had fought the Yuuzhan Vong before, she understood the nature of their threat to the galaxy. Picking up the presence of a Yuuzhan Vong fleet near them in hyperspace, they powered up the Phythea and fled to the nearest world Artorias in an attempt to warn the Artorians."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Despite their warning, they were pursued by Yuuzhan Vong vessels, who quickly caught up with them. The Chiss explorer attempted to communicate with Artorias, but the message was intercepted by an advance infiltrator, who ensured that it did not get through. After fighting off a Yuuzhan Vong boarding party, the two friends agreed they would not face capture and drove their starship into the prow of the Yuuzhan Vong cruiser, immolating themselves and their vessel."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Later, Arbeloa joined forces with the Artorian princess Kaye Galfridian and other slaves to revolt against the commander Sha'kel."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img4.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20091009095345\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/0\/0d\/WarSpec1.jpg\/200px-WarSpec1.jpg","caption":"A Cilare shows his hunting prowess."},{"src":"http:\/\/img4.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20091009095702\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/c\/cd\/WarArmy.jpg\/250px-WarArmy.jpg","caption":"The Cilare go to war."}]},{"title":"Appearances","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Star Wars: Invasion 0, Part 1","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Invasion 0, Part 2","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Invasion: Refugees 4","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Invasion: Rescues 6","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Invasion: Revelations 1","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Invasion: Revelations 2","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]},{"title":"Sources","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Jason Fry's tumblr account - EG to Warfare Endnotes Pt. 15","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]}]}
