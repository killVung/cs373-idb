Ciasi had thin torsos, and their backs had a slight bend in them, thus appearing as if they were always leaning forward. The Ciasi also had rather thin limbs that held them upright, including double-jointed legs that ended in three slender toes; the Ciasi stood upon those toes as opposed to the flats of their feet. The Ciasi's long slender arms led to hands with four thick digits\u2014three fingers and a short thumb. Ciasi also had thin tapered tails that came from their rear, which were held slightly above the ground."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"On their face, Ciasi had long, thin and trunk-like noses with two nostrils on the end. Their mouths were located below the trunk, and it was from there that the Ciasi could grow sharp, pointed tusks. Ciasi had round and beady eyes; some Ciasi, such as Slide Paramita, had black eyes. Paramita also exhibited grayish-brown colorerd skin. Ciasi also had tall, pointed ears that stuck out of the tops of their heads."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img4.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20131129162325\/starwars\/images\/e\/e0\/Slideparamitaface.png","caption":"A closeup of a Ciasi head"}]},{"title":"History","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Ciasi evolved somewhere in the galaxy, and individuals could be spotted in the galactic community by as early as 32 BBY, during the final decades of the Galactic Republic."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Ciasi in the galaxy","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"At least one Ciasi, Slide Paramita, displayed athletic prowess both physically and mentally.

Paramita achieved success on an invitational course known as the Ando Prime Centrum, as well as a drag racing course on the planet.

Ultimately, he was cut from the script, although Tund remained as the homeworld of another Podracer pilot, Ben Quadinaros.

The blog detailed several Podracer pilots who did not make into the final script for the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, using material that may have come from early draft material for The Phantom Menace. However, the species name was not considered canon at the time, due to the fact that the information may have come from older material that was never finalized, as well as doubt surrounding the nature of the information's authenticity overall. With the release of The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia in 2008, the Ciasi were mentioned again under Slide Paramita's entry, canonizing Paramita's species from the blog entry."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img4.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20140127221721\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/7\/75\/ParamitaConcept.jpg\/150px-ParamitaConcept.jpg","caption":"Ciasi concept art from The Phantom Menace"}]},{"title":"Appearances","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Star Wars: Episode I Racer","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]},{"title":"Sources","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Star Wars: Episode I: Racer: The Official Nintendo Player's Guide","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Episode I Racer: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Episode I Insider's Guide","elements":[]},{"text":"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia, Vol. III\u00a0","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]},{"title":"External links","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"\u00a0Star Wars Aliens: Recycling Abandoned Film Concepts on StarWars.com","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]}]}
