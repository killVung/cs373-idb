They were famed for their extraordinary thinking abilities, made possible by large binary brains housed in tall tapering heads, enabling them to focus on many things at the same time. Aside from this unique feature, Cereans were physically similar to Humans, although they each possessed two hearts, which supplied extra blood circulation to support their brains."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Cerean males aged more quickly than the females, who had similar lifespans to Humans. Thus, there were fewer males than females. Polygamous marriage was a necessity in order for the species to survive. Each male usually had one primary \"bond-wife,\" and between four and ten \"honor-wives.\""},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Cereans were often found among the ranks of the Jedi Knights, but due to the species' low birth rates, Cerean Jedi were exempt from the Order's vow of non-attachment.

The binary structure of Cerean thinking helped them to ponder two sides of an issue at once. It also enabled them to process information and solve problems rapidly and provided a highly advanced capacity for concentration and meditation. Because of their thoughtful nature, they tended to be calm, rational and analytical, preferring peaceful philosophies and a lifestyle which worked in harmony with nature. Though the quick-thinking Cereans had equally quick reflexes, they were commonly not as well coordinated as Humans. Because of the weight of their enlarged skulls, Cereans often had back problems."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img3.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20081013190218\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/9\/90\/Force_adept_TotG.jpg\/180px-Force_adept_TotG.jpg","caption":"A female Cerean Force Adept"}]},{"title":"Society and culture","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Cereans developed a low\u2013tech society on their homeworld and preferred to live in isolation from the wider galaxy. During the years leading up to the Invasion of Naboo, a generational dispute erupted on Cerea when the younger generation took up a rebellious stance against their low\u2013tech society. Many Cerean youths wished to own such technology as was commonplace in the Galactic Republic, like starships and speeder bikes. This unrest was ultimately quelled by Jedi Knight Ki-Adi-Mundi, who traced the instigator of the movement, Ephant Mon, to Tatooine."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Many Cereans used specially-forged Kasha crystals as a meditational tool. By focusing one's thoughts while in contact with such crystals, distractions were eliminated, creating an exceptional meditation environment.
