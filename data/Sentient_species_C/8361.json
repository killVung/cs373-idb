A memnis was as vivid to one who received it as it was to the one who participated in the event remembered. Their peace-loving natures were accounted for in part due to memnii, as having a memory of killing or harming would be particularly strong, becoming unbearable in time, and something Caamasi would seek to avoid except in defense of themselves or others, for which case they would accept their burden."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img1.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20090715043049\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/d\/d8\/Caamasi-KOTOR46.jpg\/180px-Caamasi-KOTOR46.jpg","caption":"A Caamasi baring claws and fangs"}]},{"title":"Society and culture","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"A pacifist race, culture on Caamasi evolved around the basic tenets of peace and social justice; influencing the evolution Jedi Order and their service as Knights of the Galactic Republic. Working as explorers, diplomats, and artists, the Caamasi were a monogamous people who valued single partners while mating and starting a family. So culturally ingrained was this notion that there was great debate among the species following the devastation of their homeworld. The Caamasi who were off-world at the time considered evolving to a position of polygamy so as to regrow the population. While the argument was one of survival, many sociologists familiar with the culture of the Caamasi believed that they would not accept the idea. The famed celebration known as the Rainbow of Sunshine Festival was held on Caamas annually and beloved by the populace."}],"images":[]},{"title":"History","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Caamasi possessed great moral strength and respect for others. They were among the galaxy's finest diplomats and mediators, often solving severe conflicts in a matter of days. Indeed, as the Jedi Order began to evolve on Ossus, Jedi scholars studied on Caamas and drew upon the teachings of Hespecia Tik'kla when creating the Jedi Code. During the last stages of the Pius Dea Crusades around 11,000 BBY, the Caamasi opposed the Pius Dea-controlled Galactic Republic's inquistions against domestic opposition. They succeeded in persuading the Jedi to end their centuries-long Recusal and collaborated with the Jedi and Alsakani to mastermind an anti-Pius Dea heresy which developed into the Renunciates movement by 10,967 BBY. During the Pius Dea Civil War, the Caamasi were part of a broad anti-Pius Dea coalition which toppled the sect and ended its grip on the Republic. Following the Battle of Uquine, the last Pius Dea Supreme Chancellor Contispex XIX was tried and imprisoned for life on Caamas."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"During the last days of the Galactic Republic, Senior Anthropologist Mammon Hoole witnessed the Caamasi prowess firsthand when they negotiated peace between the Kubaz and the Verpine. Unfortunately, the Caamasi pacifism was at odds with Emperor Palpatine's New Order, and they suffered greatly under Imperial rule. A few months after the end of the Clone Wars, the surface of their homeworld, Caamas, was bombarded, killing millions. After the destruction of their planet's environment, many refugees moved to Alderaan, Kerilt, and Susevfi. The bombardment was aided by a group of Bothans who sabotaged Caamas' shield generators. The Caamas Document detailed their involvement. Although many demanded that the Bothans purchase an uninhabited planet and terraform it according to Caamas' specifications, the Caamasi chose to forgive those guilty of harming them."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Following years of struggling to repopulate the species, the Caamasi Remnant and its leader, Elegos A'Kla, joined the New Republic Senate and participated in the hazardous political turmoil surrounding the Yuuzhan Vong War."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img1.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20130630170730\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/f\/f7\/Caamasi-TFUCG.png\/160px-Caamasi-TFUCG.png","caption":""}]},{"title":"Caamasi in the galaxy","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Caamasi who found themselves away from their homeworld typically worked as diplomats or law-givers at the side of politicians and planetary rulers across the Galactic Republic.
