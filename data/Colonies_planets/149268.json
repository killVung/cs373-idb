He obtained financial backing from some friends, enough to buy OM813 (renamed Thrantin). Then, during the four decades after it, Warren planetscaped all of Thrantin, aiming to create a training camp. While Warren admitted he should take students to different worlds to teach them, he also believed in having a \"controlled environment\" to ensure that none of his students could cheat. Warren thus created Zero-G areas, an Ammonia Ocean and the Heavy Grav Mountainous Zones."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Since that moment, Thrantin became the planet-wide Galactic Outdoor Survival School, directed by Warren himself with a specialized staff.
