Embroiled in a terrible, centuries-long war, the planet's natives were nearly driven to extinction by a species known as the Lontars. Intervening in the conflict, the Galactic Senate demanded a cessation of violence on the world and Batorine formally joined the ancient institution in 110 BBY. A world of artisans and assassins, Batorine's population remained less then one million sentients long after the conflict ended; many Blood Carvers relocated to secret enclaves on the Republic capital world, Coruscant."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Appearances","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Rogue Planet","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Legacy 38: Tatooine, Part 2","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]},{"title":"Sources","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Ultimate Alien Anthology","elements":[]},{"text":"The Essential Guide to Alien Species","elements":[]},{"text":"Scum and Villainy","elements":[]},{"text":"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]}]}
