Its population included individuals from a number of sentient species, such as Aqualish, Barabels, Bothans, Duros, Humans and Ishori. A short distance from a spaceport on the planet was a plaza that contained the Stand of Public Expression. The plaza was lined with paved pathways and flowerbeds, and was bordered by the Bothan-owned Solferin Shipping Company. In 19 ABY, Drend Navett, Klif and several other Imperial agitators instigated a riot against the Solferin Shipping Company, ostensibly in outrage at Bothan involvement in the Destruction of Caamas in 19 BBY."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img4.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20140430180744\/starwars\/images\/8\/8d\/Eras-legends.png"}]},{"title":"Appearances","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Specter of the Past","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]},{"title":"Sources","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"The Essential Atlas","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]}]}
