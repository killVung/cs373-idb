With their tough hides, large claws and intelligence, the Mandalorians used them as mounts for aerial and ground fighting during later wars including the New Sith Wars. Because of this, the Basiliskans degenerated, losing their intelligence and becoming mere beasts. As such, since the Battle of Basilisk in 4017 BBY, they were re-named the Lagartoz War Dragons."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img4.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20140430180744\/starwars\/images\/8\/8d\/Eras-legends.png"},{"src":"http:\/\/img3.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20050507004708\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/6\/67\/80SithWar.jpg\/250px-80SithWar.jpg","caption":"Lagartoz War Dragons and Mandalorian troops during a campaign in the New Sith Wars against one of the Dark Underlord's Sith Generals."}]},{"title":"Appearances","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Star Wars: The Old Republic","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars Galaxies","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]},{"title":"Sources","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Knights of the Old Republic Campaign Guide","elements":[]},{"text":"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia","elements":[]},{"text":"\"The History of the Mandalorians\"\u2014Star Wars Insider 80","elements":[]},{"text":"The Essential Guide to Warfare","elements":[]},{"text":"\u00a0\"Drawing from the Imagination: Mythological Creatures in Star Wars, Part 1,\" The Official Star Wars Blog","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]}]}
