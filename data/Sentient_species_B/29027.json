For that reason, their most striking features were their leather-like, membranous vestigial wings. With the arm stretched out from the body, that part of their anatomy looked like the wing of a mynock, a silicon-based parasite commonly found across the galaxy. The Bovorians, however, could not fly, and their wings were only leftovers of their evolutionary process."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Overall, Bovorians had a humanoid body characterized by a single head, a torso and four limbs attached to it. Their bodies were slightly thinner and longer than those of Humans, with an average height rangin from 1.8 to 2.3 meters. The Bovorians were noted for their acute sense of hearing that gave them the ability to detect movement from up to a kilometer away. They could also see in the infrared spectrum, thus allowing them to see in complete darkness as long as there were heat sources nearby."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Like some other species that included the Vors and the Chadra-Fan, the Bovorians were fifteen times more likely than others to catch pollution-induced respiratory ailments such as lungrot, silicalung, hemorrhagic molting and dioxo-brionchiectasis shock."}],"images":[]},{"title":"History","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Bovorians evolved on the jungle-covered planet of Bovo Yagen, in the Kailion sector of the Expansion Region of the galaxy.
