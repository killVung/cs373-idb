They believed in the Art Beyond Dying, and had orange blood. Their noses served as both olfactory and auditory systems. Among Blood Carvers, extension was an extreme form of probation, a temporary exile from one's clan. Tribal tattoos were common for Blood Carvers, typically lining their upper lips."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Society and culture","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Their name officially came from the statues they carved from blood red trees. When a Blood Carver presented a statue, it immediately wanted flaws pointed out, while compliments were actually tantamount to insults. Creatures had been executed for complimenting works of art. The statues were made for the betterment of the tribe, not the individual."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The second reason for their name came from the fact that they were very skilled assassins, though it was quite rare for a Blood Carver to mutilate their target.

The survivors were taken to Coruscant, where they stayed in seclusion. By 29 BBY, there were only several hundred of them left on the planet. Blood Carvers also had a colony on Alderaan before its destruction. Blood Carvers exiled from Batorine sometimes gravitated to small pocket colonies of their own species, sometimes as remote as Nar Shaddaa and other Outer Rim worlds."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Blood Carvers in the galaxy","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"On Batorine, Blood Carvers were fiercely loyal to their tribes. Those who ventured offworld projected that loyalty on their new companions. Except for exiles, Blood Carvers rarely traveled alone. They found flattery and excess alike offensive and usually disdained egoism or material wealth. Those showing hints of greed or pride were exiled from Batorine. While there were Force-sensitive Blood Carvers, they tended to form their own groups of Force Adepts rather than joining the Jedi Order."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Appearances","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 46: Destroyer, Part 2","elements":[]},{"text":"\"Marked\"\u2014Star Wars Tales 24","elements":[]},{"text":"Rogue Planet","elements":[]},{"text":"Anakin: Apprentice","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: The Clone Wars novel","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Dark Times: The Path to Nowhere","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Dark Times: Parallels","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Dark Times: Vector","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Dark Times 13: Blue Harvest, Part 1","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Dark Times 15: Blue Harvest, Part 3","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Dark Times 17: Blue Harvest, Part 5","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Dark Times 18: Out of the Wilderness, Part 1","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Dark Times 19: Out of the Wilderness, Part 2","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Dark Times 20: Out of the Wilderness, Part 3","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Dark Times 22: Out of the Wilderness, Part 5","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Dark Times 28: A Spark Remains, Part 1","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Dark Times 29: A Spark Remains, Part 2","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Dark Times 30: A Spark Remains, Part 3","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Dark Times 31: A Spark Remains, Part 4","elements":[]},{"text":"The New Jedi Order: Force Heretic III: Reunion","elements":[]},{"text":"Star Wars: Legacy: Tatooine","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]},{"title":"Sources","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"The Essential Guide to Alien Species","elements":[]},{"text":"\"Who's Who in the Jedi Order\"\u2014Star Wars Insider 62","elements":[]},{"text":"Ultimate Alien Anthology","elements":[]},{"text":"The New Essential Guide to Vehicles and Vessels","elements":[]},{"text":"\u00a0\"Race for the Tessent\"\u2014Star Wars Gamer 9","elements":[]},{"text":"A Mon Alone","elements":[]},{"text":"Scum and Villainy","elements":[]},{"text":"\"Jawa's Corner\"\u2014Star Wars Insider 95","elements":[]},{"text":"The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia","elements":[]},{"text":"The Essential Reader's Companion","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]}]}
