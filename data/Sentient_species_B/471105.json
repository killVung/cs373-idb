Sometime during their history, the species worshiped a demon named Malmourral.

The Bardottans later formed the group known as the Dagoyan Masters, who ruled Bardotta, led by a queen. In addition, the Bardottans were also led by the Bahk-tov Council. During the Clone Wars, the Bardottan leader was Queen Julia. By this time, the Frangawl Cult had begun kidnapping the Dagoyan Masters, and were sacrificing them to Malmourral while obtaining their inherent Force energy.

Either way, Bardottans were thin aliens with long, curved necks, pointed skulls, and in some cases, colorful head crests.

During their history, members of the species worshiped a demon named Malmourral. This religion later shrank into obscurity, and Bardotta planet fell under the control of the Dagoyan Masters and the Bahk-tov Council. This government system, by the time of the intergalactic Clone Wars, was ruled over by Queen Julia and High Seneschal Peteen. At some point, the Dagoyan Masters began to despise the Jedi Order, as they believed the Jedi to be thieves. Later, Peteen had allied with the Dathomirian Nightsister Mother Talzin and revived the religion of Malmourral, naming it the Frangawl Cult. This revived cult also catered to non-Bardottans, such as the Ming Po and Zygerrians. A Frangawl base was established on the planet Zardossa Stix. During the Clone Wars, Peteen's cult began to kidnap members of the Dagoyan Masters. The Dagoyans were brought to a ritual temple underneath the main government temple, where they were sacrificed to Malmourral, and their Force energy was harvested into small orb like devices. One of the hostages was the Dagoyan Master Joseph."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Julia contacted the Galactic Republic for aid, and requested that help be sent in the form of the Gungan representative Jar Jar Binks. The Jedi, fearing a greater cause for concern from the kidnappings, also sent Jedi master Mace Windu. Arriving on Bardotta, they were received by Peteen and the guardsman Savatte. Although Windu felt a great darkness overcoming the planet, he could not pinpoint it. Eventually, Julia herself was kidnapped. Windu, Binks, and Savatte tracked her to the underground caves beneath the government temple, where Binks was kidnapped. Savatte left to find help, while Windu tracked Binks with a comlink. Meanwhile, a Dagoyan Master was sacrificed and harvested by Peteen. Binks was later freed, and together with Windu defeated the cultists and freed the other masters, including Joseph. Peteen, however, escaped to Zardossa Stix with Julia. Windu and Binks gave chase, and after several skirmishes with cultists and Mother Talzin, Peteen was killed, Talzin retreated, and Julia was rescued."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Not all Bardottans identified as a Bardottan."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img1.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20150411014735\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/9\/91\/BardottanCouncil.png\/275px-BardottanCouncil.png","caption":"The Bahk-tov Council listens to a speech from Peteen"}]},{"title":"Bardottans in the galaxy","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"For a time, Bardottan children were inducted in the Jedi Order.
