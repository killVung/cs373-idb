They were native to Kaisa, a planet located in the Corva sector of the Outer Rim Territories. The Buro had no presence offworld, but their homeworld did receive some visitors, among them a Human-crewed, geological survey starship.

The Alliance's leader, Nolaa Tarkona, tasked the Chironian operative Lusa with wiping clean the navigation computers of the survey crew's starship; their next jump into hyperspace would see them emerge in uncharted territory.
