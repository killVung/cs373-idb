The threat posed by Karkko's increasing bloodlust caused the Jedi High Council to rise up in battle against him, a fight which the Anzat ultimately lost. Rather than eliminating Karkko, the Council placed him in stasis on the prison world of Kiffex. For a millennium he remained incarcerated, left in full mental consciousness by the Council so that he might contemplate the error of his ways. Karkko, however, refused to renounce the dark side, and spent his time in isolation plotting his revenge against those who had imprisoned him. He became something of a legend among his kind over the years; other Anzati were drawn to Kiffex by Karkko's mental summons, and through their worship at the feet of the man whom they regarded as the \"Dark Dreamer,\" his prison was transformed into a place of hallowed ground.

He placed his new student in command of his Anzat slaves and sent them to terrorize the populace of Kiffex in an attempt to attract the attention of the Jedi. Several Jedi responded, but only one, Aayla Secura's former Master Quinlan Vos, actually entered Karkko's stronghold to confront him. When the Dark Jedi's enchantment over Secura was broken by Vos, Karkko attempted to seduce Vos to the dark side, to no avail.

He was already more than eight hundred years old when his Force sensitivity was discovered by a member of the Jedi Order, and he was selected for Jedi training, during a time when enrollment was not restricted to children. Karkko eventually became a powerful\u2014but arrogant\u2014Jedi Master, one whose service to the Order over the years was nothing short of exemplary. Karkko was also well-known for the excessive amount of time he spent studying one of the Jedi Order's rare Sith holocrons kept within the Temple's Archives. He delighted himself in reminding other Jedi that his people remembered the first Sith Lords, though even with his extensive scrutiny of the holocron, there appeared to be no actual evidence to substantiate his claim."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Fall to the dark side","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Some members of the Jedi Order, among them the Jedi High Council itself, believed that training Anzati to use the Force was a dangerous affair, and there were fears that Volfe Karkko would not be able to resist his species' instinctive need to taste the \"soup,\" or life energy, of other sentients. Karkko vehemently dismissed these concerns, as his pride led him to believe that succumbing to such afflictions was beneath a Jedi as accomplished as him. He reasoned that because he had never tasted soup before, a single experience would be harmless. Upon his first taste, however, Karkko immediately became addicted, and craved soup ever thereafter. With his Jedi abilities, he began preying on other members of the Order, and through consumption of their essence Karkko became stronger in the Force. The Anzat fell to the dark side as a result and believed that he could single-handedly conquer the galaxy."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Karkko's ambitions were deemed a threat to the Order, and the Jedi Council was forced to intervene. The Anzat fled to the world Kiffex in an effort to escape persecution, but he was still pursued by the Council. A battle ensued when they found him, during which Karkko held his own for a time. He was ultimately defeated by the Councilors who, rather than kill him, imprisoned him in a stasis field. Karkko was unable to move but remained in full consciousness, sentenced to a period of solitary confinement and left to reflect on his transgressions. Karkko's lightsaber was placed nearby in a miniature stasis field to serve both as a reminder to him of his former Jedi life, and as a warning to others of what could also befall them. The building on Kiffex which served as Karkko's prison was sealed to prevent anyone other than Jedi from gaining access."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The memory of Volfe Karkko's downfall remained prominent throughout his one-thousand-year imprisonment. He achieved legendary status among the Anzat people as well as the Jedi, and his tale was even recorded in a holocron which remained locked away in the Holocron Chamber of the Jedi Temple's Tower of First Knowledge. Karkko's perpetual isolation on Kiffex did nothing to sway his allegiance to the dark side, however. While in solitude, he spent his time plotting the downfall of the Jedi Order and the resources such an aspiration required. As the centuries passed, Karkko's prison became a place of concentrated dark side power. His conscious spirit telepathically called to other Anzati and lured them to Kiffex. They were able to infiltrate his prison, where they worshiped at the feet of the one whom they called \"The Dreaming One.\" He corrupted them with his power, and by mentally draining the essence of his supplicants, Karkko was able to replenish his own strength. The Dark Jedi soon had an army of feral Anzat slaves, utterly devoid of sentience and completely bound to his will. None of the sycophants were able to release Karkko from the stasis field, something only another Jedi was capable of."}],"images":[{"src":"http:\/\/img1.wikia.nocookie.net\/__cb20100312053905\/starwars\/images\/thumb\/3\/3e\/VolfeFalls-Darkness.jpg\/250px-VolfeFalls-Darkness.jpg","caption":"Volfe Karkko battles the Jedi Council on Kiffex."}]},{"title":"Freedom","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"In 30 BBY, after a thousand years in stasis, Volfe Karkko was finally granted an opportunity to escape confinement when a Twi'lek Jedi Padawan named Aayla Secura arrived on Kiffex.

It was through her anger at Vos and desire for revenge that Volfe Karkko sensed Secura's presence and began corrupting her to the dark side. He telepathically called her to his domicile and persuaded her to release him from stasis. Initially tempted with consuming the soup of a Jedi in such close proximity to him, Karkko resisted the urge to sup on her brain matter despite the deprivation he had long been forced to endure.

They attacked the patrons of the Black Hole cantina, but were opposed by Vos, Tholme, and a third Jedi, the Veknoid Master Zao. While Karkko's slaves harvested from the patrons of the cantina, his Twi'lek apprentice briefly fought her former Master, until a telepathic suggestion from Karkko reminded her that the mission he had sent her on superseded her need for vengeance. Secura, along with Karkko's Anzat minions, then fled the cantina, but the Jedi were in fast pursuit. After gaining a significant lead on them, Secura ordered the Anzati to hide themselves and ambush the Jedi when they passed, making sure to take them alive if possible so that Karkko could feast upon their soup.

Karkko then appeared behind Vos and used the Force to slam him into a nearby wall. He pressed his advantage but was halted when Vos unleashed a torrent of Force lightning, an ability the Anzat had not expected a proponent of the light to employ. Stalled only momentarily, Karkko projected his own lightning, the strength of which disabled Vos long enough for Karkko to prepare to harvest his soup. Contrarily, the Anzat neglected to account for Vos' companions outside the fortress\u2014Masters Tholme, T'ra Saa, and Zao\u2014whose combined power in the Force gave Vos enough strength to break Karkko's telepathic hold over him.

Karkko had been something of a role model for Tyris, who painstakingly studied the teachings of his predecessor. Tempted by Dooku's promise of power, Tyris fell to the dark side and abandoned the Jedi Order as Karkko had done before him.

The teachings of Volfe Karkko regarding the Sith, which he compiled from various sources of Sith lore, were considered unorthodox by his Jedi peers. Karkko felt he was superior to the compelling nature of soup consumption and cited his Jedi training as the reason why such shortcomings had no affect on him. His first indulgence was based on that belief and resulted in a subsequent addiction. Over time, he developed a preference for other Jedi to satisfy his cravings.

By 30 BBY, the fear of Karkko's freedom was still a cause of distress among the members of the current Jedi Council, and preventing his escape was a priority of the highest order. By the time Karkko was set free, his primary concerns included tasting soup and leaving Kiffex. He was content with delaying his soup craving for the more important escape, a plan he enacted upon his release. Karkko desired the essence of a Jedi to satisfy his craving, and he anticipated the arrival of those whom he was certain would respond once they became aware of his new-found freedom. Karkko was angered by the treachery of Aayla Secura, whom he considered a turncoat after his spell over her had been broken by Quinlan Vos.

While in stasis on Kiffex, Karkko's dark side aura permeated first his prison, and then the planet itself. He was still able to manipulate the Force and used it as the medium through which he summoned members of his species from as far as Anzat to his prison. Continuous exposure to Karkko's telepathic influence eroded their sentience, and with time, he bound all of them to his will. Karkko subjected Aayla Secura to the same treatment upon her arrival on Kiffex, taking advantage of her fragile mental state in order to convert the amnesiac Jedi to his service. Aside from telepathy, Karkko was skilled with Force lightning, an ability over which he touted total mastery.
